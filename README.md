The Banking System Project is a command-line interface built with object-relational mapping (ORM) using the Jakarta EE server. It enables system administrators to perform various tasks, such as adding customers, creating deposit accounts, issuing replacement ATM cards, and allowing customers to insert ATM cards. Customers can also change their PIN and check the available balance in their connected deposit accounts.
